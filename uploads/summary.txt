Sulfuric acid, also known as dihydrogen sulfate, has various names related to its historical production methods and uses, such as battery acid, chamber acid, tower acid, Glover's acid, or English sulfuric acid. It also goes by the archaic term vitriol due to its glass-like luster. The term vitriol is mainly used today to refer to certain minerals. The history of sulfuric acid is hard to trace back before the 16th century, with early uses involving sulfate minerals, which were known as vitriols. These minerals, which include sulfates of iron, copper, magnesium, and zinc, were extensively documented by ancient scholars such as Pedanius Dioscorides and Pliny the Elder, and were used in various applications, including gold purification. The categorization of natural substances by RƒÅzi mentions vitriol, a sulfate of copper and iron, as a vital component of minerals. This categorization was similar to those adopted by individuals such as Jabir ibn Hayyan, Avicenna, and Muhammad ibn Ibrahim al-Watwat in more recent centuries.
The text discusses the development of sulfuric acid and its production processes over various centuries. It was widely researched in medieval Europe, with experiments contributing to progress in dye and pigment production. The initial preparation involved roasting iron(II) sulfate, alum, or other sulfate minerals. Sulfuric acid production evolved in the 17th century using Glauber's method which involved heating sulfur and saltpeter in steam. This process was optimized by Joshua Ward in 1736 allowing large-scale, cost-effective production. Glauber's oxidation method, also known as the lead chamber process, used sulfide-rich ores to create sulfur dioxide but could reach a maximum concentration of 78%. For higher concentrations, a more complex and expensive method was used. The 18th century saw the emergence of many sulfuric acid factories, mainly in the UK, Duisburg, Lille, and Amsterdam. Major advancements were made in the 19th century with improvements to the production process and scientific studies into sulfuric acid, including the introduction of a process that used platinum.
The text discusses the evolution of methods in producing sulfuric acid. Initially, a less scalable method using an unspecified catalyst was employed, which proved ineffective quickly. Later, the use of finely-divided platinum became popular due to its durability, but it was costly. In 1899, scientists shifted to vanadium(V) oxide as a catalyst. The resulting process, referred to as the contact process, is still the most widely used method for sulfuric acid production today.
